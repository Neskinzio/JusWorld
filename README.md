# JusWorld
This is my first project ever! It started as a photoshop design for my girlfriend's school assignment and it turned into an awesome learning experience.
The goal is to turn this website into a nice user experience and learn to build a solid HTML/CSS project at the same time!

NOTE: Open when using a 1366x768 resolution in order to visualize correctly what I'm trying to build (haven't learned how to make a responsive design yet!)
